# Making a Pull Request

This is a suggested process, individual repositories will want pull requests to be constructed differently. Check a repos "CONTRIBUTING.md" for specific guidelines and ask if you are unsure!

## Suggested Pull Request Process

- Clone repository locally
- Create a new branch off the master branch
- Make changes with clear commits following [good commit guidelines](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- Pull down any changes that might have happened whilst you were making your changes and merge them in locally.
- Push the branch you made your changes on up to the server
- Create a pull request from the branch into master
- A build will be triggered and go green before a PR is accepted
- The changes will be reviewed by the owners of the repo and can suggest changes
- Make suggested changes and push them up to the branch again
- Owner of the repository will accept and merge your changes into master

NOTE: If you are making a large feature/architectural changes, open an issue first and discuss it with the owner as they might have additional insights or don't think it is appropriate for the repo.
