# Technologies List

Tools and technologies being used by UKHO engineering teams. Investigation of these technologies will have a sponsor and will either be investigated within a team (perhaps through an agile Spike), during a JFDI activity or by the architecture practice.

These lists have been agreed and approved by the Lead Engineer Forum and the Architecture Team and will be reviewed on a regular basis with the latest version published here.

## Horizon

If a technology is on this list it means that time can be spent investigating it (e.g. on JFDIs).
