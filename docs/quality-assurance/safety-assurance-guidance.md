# Safety Assurance Guidelines

##What is a Safety Modelling and when to do it

It should be focused around the two key areas of

1\. Error (Data Integrity)

2\. Delay

This is very much focused around 'What if' questions and then of those 'What if' questions, what would the safety impact of that occurring, or indeed not occurring and then the likely
hod or not of that occuring.

At the start of a project

Carry out a bowtie analysis of the project as that will help identify the potential areas of safety that may need to be considered (There area number of safety assurance experts who can help you in carrying out this analysis)

### During Sprints

 * Relevant PBI's tagged with a safety tag along with relevant details of what will be done to mitigate the safety impact. If it is not clear if there is a safety impaact you 

   can use a tage of safety pending until it is clearer.

 * Some initial test design thoughts on how the risk could be tested for. Given that these are  negative tests there will be a  balance between effort required to test against

   likelihood/impact

* A final decision as to the safety impact/consequence would like with the PO (The PO will engage with other SME's to determine if   the safety risk is acceptable). This may 

   mean that although there is a potential safety risk that risk is deemed manageable or may  require remedial action. Again this detail should be captured in a lightweight

   manner within the relevant PBI.
