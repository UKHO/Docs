# What are safety assurance guidelines

They are guidlines to consider when looking at what to test , while we test functionality , do we consider the safery of the product, what happens
if something fails.
A example could be funtionality some data is not displayed, or the wrong data is displayed. Both have an impact but which one would impact safety
the most.

So we actually consider safety all the time, we just probably don't really think about it in that way. This provides some guidelines to think about when planning what type of tests you may wish to design for a chamge.

## Things to consider

* All requirements have acceptance criteria
* All acceptance criteria have a test(s) linked to them
* All requirements (PBIâ€™s) have acceptance criteria
* There is a regression pack (If applicable)
* An auditable history of test runs (Automated and manual) is kept
* We have run a risk review so that the functionality with the largest safety impact is considered and potential priority (This is 
  something that the product owner would sign off on)
