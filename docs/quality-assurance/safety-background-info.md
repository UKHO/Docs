# Definitions

## Hazard
A hazard is an “intermediate state where the potential for harm exists”. It is not something undesirable, negative or unintentional; driving to work is a hazard and yet we do it every day. In the Bowtie method, a hazard is not an issue until it becomes uncontrolled.
The hazard provides structure, context and boundaries to what a bowtie may (and may not) include. It helps focus all subsequent elements of a bowtie and should be used to make its scope manageable.

## Top Event 

A top event is “A point in time that describes the release or loss of control over a Hazard”. Top events can also be described as ‘Loss of control events’. Start by looking at the hazard that the top event derives from and think of the ways that you may lose control of it.
Top events are an important aspect of a bowtie as they represent the “pivot point” around which all subsequent elements are built. For each hazard there are often several top events, which require separate bowties to be built.

## Consequences

Consequences are the undesirable outcomes (usually accidents) that follow on from the release of a top event if the event is not stopped by a barrier. 

## Threats are “Factors that could cause the top event”

Within Bowtie structures more generally for each top event there are usually several threats. A threat should NOT describe a failed barrier (e.g. Fails to follow process X).
A threat should NOT need to be combined with other threats to cause the top event to occur (i.e. each threat on its own can conceivably cause the top event to occur).

## Barriers

Barriers are “any measure taken that acts against some undesirable force or intention, in order to maintain a desired state”.
Barriers in the bowtie appear on both sides of the top event. Barriers on the left side are designed to prevent threats from occurring (Preventative Barriers) , and if they do, prevent them from causing a loss of control (ie top event being released). Barriers on the right side make sure that if the top event is reached, they prevent a consequence from being realised or mitigate the impact if it does (Recovery Barriers) • A barrier must be something that prevents an occurrence • A barrier must be specific • Barriers also eliminate threats and reduce the severity of consequences.

## Escalation

Escalation factors are “conditions that can make a barrier fail”. They connect to barriers and detail any condition, situation or factor that can make them fail, increasing the chance of a top event or a consequence occurring. They are a useful way of identifying specific factors that can work against the effectiveness of barriers.
Escalation factors are often misapplied and over-used, with a plethora appearing on bowties, making them hard to interpret, distorting the visualisation of risk and making them so complex that they cease to be effective. Not all potential conditions that can make a barrier fail need to be annotated, only the real weaknesses that need to be managed.

## Activties

Activities are “detailed tasks that need to be executed in order for a barrier to be fully functional.
Activities can be a powerful part of the Bowtie management approach as they recognise the reality that a barrier is often not owned by one individual, rather it is made up of a number of activities delivered by different individuals or organisations

## Other things to consider

Two examples of what if :

* What if the system fails, how quickly could it be recovered. It that recovery would take 2 days what risk to the mariner would that 
 delay cause. Are there any mitigations that could be put in place, if so then the two days may be acceptable,if not and the delay could
 potentially impact the safety of the mariner then another soloution to the recovery would need to be found.
 
 * What if an ENC was corrupted, what would the safety impact be. Can the system determine a corrupted cell and if so what alert 
   mechanism would need to be in place.
   
 * You may need to test to understand what systemtc failures could occure to understand the risk and impact. So if you increase volumes 
   by 50% does that crash the system, if it does then how quickly can it be recovered. This type of testing is to understand and see 
   what happens, it provides answers to some of the 'What if'. Unless you test you will not necessarily know , you may have an idea but 
   you need to test tovalidate or not that idea.
   
   # Consider the whole system (Safety guided design)
   
   It is not enough just to consider individual PBI's but also how the whole system will interact with each other, individual elements 
   may be fine when run in isolation but when combined and under certain conditions they may trigger abnomral events , which could 
   impact the safety of the system.
   
   The intergration and relationships between software/hardwareas well as how the user will interact with it ,  needs therefor to be 
   considered as well as individual elements.
 
   # Consider the how the system will be used
   
   Besides how the system will operate, consideration needs also to be given to how the end use will operate/intreact 
   with the system.
   
   * Can the user select options in such a way as to be provided with incorrect information
   * Is the information presented to the user that does not cause confusion/misunderstanding (UX Design)
   * What other ways that the user could use the system regardless of if they should that could impact safety
