# Acceptance Criteria Guidance
This page provides tips on writing acceptance criteria.

## What is Acceptance Criteria?
> conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by a user, customer or other stakeholders. [Microsoft Press]

## Why write good Acceptance Criteria?
To ensure that all the members of the team are on the same page and establish a shared understanding among all team members.

## How do I know I am doing it right?

1. The WHOLE team is involved in the creation and refinement of AC
1. AC is agreed and written before a user story is played
1. Every user story has at least 1 and a maximum of 5 ACs - too many ACs? Split the PBI into smaller deliverables 
1. All criterion are independently testable with a clear pass / fail outcome
1. Non-functional criteria is included where applicable

## How to generate good Acceptance Criteria

1. Generated through Example Mapping  -( We should have a link to what example mapping is)
1. It is recorded in a scenario-orientated format - “Given…When…Then…” - the expected observable result
