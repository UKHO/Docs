# Acceptance Criteria Guidance
This page provides tips on writing Acceptance Criteria.

## What is Acceptance Criteria?
“conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by a user, customer or other stakeholders.” [Microsoft Press]


## Why write good Acceptance Criteria?
To ensure that all the members of the team are on the same page and establish a shared understanding among all team members.

## Writing Acceptance Criteria

The list below outlines what should be involved when writing good Acceptance Criteria

 1. The WHOLE team is involved in the creation and refinement
 2. Generated through Example Mapping
 3. Recorded in a Scenario-orientated format - “Given…When…Then…” - The expected observable result
 4. Agreed and written before implementation
 5. Every deliverable PBI should have at least 1 AC
 6. PBIs should have between 1 and 5? ACs - Too many ACs? Split the PBI into smaller deliverables 
 8. All criterion are independently testable with a clear Pass / Fail outcome
 9. Non-functional criteria included where applicable and relevant
 
Make sure all items are [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)
	* Specific – target a specific area for improvement.
	* Measurable – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
	* Assignable – specify who will do it.
	* Realistic – state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.
	* Time-related – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.
