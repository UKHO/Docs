### 1. We utilise a shift left mindset (quality is baked in)

Quality starts at the very beginning of a project, it is not just something related to testing, we champion product quality from the very beginning.

### 2. We test at every stage of a product&#39;s lifecycle (continuously testing)

Testing begins before any code is written and continues through every stage ensuring that the product is tested the right way at the right time.

### 3. We automate 100% of what is automatable

Automation is key to delivering in a Devops world, we seek to automate everything that can be, allowing us to move faster and with greater certainty.

### 4. We use agile principles at every stage of our work

We must be flexible and adaptable , delivering value quickly to our customers, using agile principles helps us do that.

### 5. We use behaviour driven development to help us deliver value to our customers

BDD helps teams focus on the most valuable work to deliver, it helps clarify and ensure that misunderstanding is reduced so that the right product is built the right way.

### 6. We take a holistic view of a product when testing

We look to view the product as a whole ensuring that Testing encompasses non-functional as well as the functional areas of that product.

### 7. We adopt a continuous improvement mentality to our skills

We are always learning, our people are key to our delivery and by always seeking to learn we allow ourselves to introduce new ideas, ways of working, to try new things.

### 8. We collaborate across Government to learn and to teach

We are looking across wider government to learn from other organisations  and also to pass onto things that could help other government organisations.

### 9. We look to our partners to work to the same principles

With our teams working to the principles, working with partners who work to similar ones can make the working relationships between us and the partner very productive.
