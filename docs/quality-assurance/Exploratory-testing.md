# Exploratory Testing

Exploratory testing is a vital element of the UKHO overall test strategy, it compliments the automated and manual testing that teams carry out. It allows the full analytically 
abilities of the test engineer to come to the fore. It has been well proven that exploratory testing is a great method for uncovering bugs along side the other testing types 
that teams use.

Exploratory testing empowers test engineers to test organically and enhance functionality. It requires less formality, the following of rigid structures and encourage experimentation, discovery and creativity, while documenting findings.
