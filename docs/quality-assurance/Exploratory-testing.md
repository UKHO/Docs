# Exploratory Testing

Exploratory testing is a vital element of the UKHO overall test strategy; it compliments the automated and manual testing that teams carry out. It allows the full analytical abilities of the test engineer to come to the fore. It has been well proven that exploratory testing is a great method for uncovering bugs alongside the other testing types that teams use.

Exploratory testing empowers test engineers to test organically and enhance functionality. It requires less formality, not following rigid structures and encouraging experimentation, discovery and creativity, while documenting findings.

## UKHO Guidelines for exploratory testing

1. An element of exploratory testing should be included in every project, the amount should be down to the team to determine
2. One of the different types should be included
3. While not formally documented, a task should be created for the testing and the area(s) of functionality explored noted along with any observations
4. Timebox the activity - one hour per session is the norm
5. UI Interfaces, databases and general data manipulation are good areas to explore.

3. Testing freestyle

### Test Charters

A test charter is a way of focusing on what you will test but without being too prescriptive. The charter can outline:

* What parts of the system you'll be looking at (also known as your mission scope)
* Your testing goals, e.g. make sure a system is secure enough for people to use
* Details of the team doing the exploratory testing
* The date and times of the testing
* The test environment, e.g. the software you'll use to do the test
* Mock data you'll need for testing, e.g. a mock username or password
* The details should be no more than the size of a tweet.

You can use a test charter on anything from a very small part of the system to a whole system. An example of a very small charter might be:

* Examine one screen, its inputs and responses
* Running a process end-to-end across all screens

### Other things to consider

* Use personas
* Use test tours (You tour around an area of the application)
