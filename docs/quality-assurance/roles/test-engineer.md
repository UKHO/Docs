# Test Engineer

|  Areas | Tasks | Stories |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ​Deliver, under tuition, test automation as part of the Delivery Team (35%) | ​Writing test automation code | ​A user story requires automated tests; it is building on existing functionality so the test engineer can use existing automation code and add in the extra tests. |  
| Create relevant test documents for project (e.g Test Approach, Test Summary Report) (5%)) | Responsible for the creation of the Test Approach and Test Summary reports as required | At the start of a project the test engineer takes ownership of producing the relevant document that provides details on how testing of the product will be undertaken. This will be produced in conjunction with and presented back to the rest of the team. If required, the test engineer will create a Test Summary Report that provides an overview of the testing completed. |  
| Assist with the resolution of defects by recording them in the project, communicating effectively on the issue and carrying out re-tests as required (5%). | Raise good quality defects | The test engineer discovers a defect in a product. They raise a defect and include details on the impact, how the defect can be re-created and its importance. |
| ​ | ​Ensures that all defects raised within a sprint are followed up | ​There are several open defects, the test engineer can see that if one of them is fixed it will allow a PBI to be completed. They discuss with the developers and they agree to focus on that defect first. |
| Analysing Requirements and designing manual or automated tests (25%) | Review requirements to understand how they can be tested | The test engineer sees that altering the requirement would help the testing, so they discuss this with the rest of the team. |
| ​ | ​Design manual tests | ​A feature needs to be manually tested so the test engineer uses test design techniques to create both happy and unhappy path test plans. |
| ​ | ​Design Automated tests | ​A feature will need automated tests; the test engineer uses test design techniques to create the relevant automated tests. |
| ​Carry out Testing (25%) | Leads the use of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) within the delivery team | The team is finding it challenging to add acceptance criteria to user stories. They work with the Delivery Manager and the team using BDD techniques to create acceptance criteria. |
| ​ | Carries out exploratory testing  | A feature is under test; the test engineer feels that some exploratory testing will help look for defects.  They use a test charter and test persona to carry out some exploratory testing. |
| ​ | ​Runs any manual testing  | ​The test engineer recommends that some user stories are better suited to manual testing and agrees the approach with the team. |
| ​ | ​Ensure that automated test suites are being used and any failures followed up | ​The test engineer notices that some of the automated tests have failed; they investigate and seeks support/advice form other members of the team if needed. |
| ​ | Has some responsibility for ensuring that testing on a project adds up to a coherent whole | A project uses several different testing techniques - automated, manual, non-functional. The test engineer sees that there is a lack of security testing, so they recommend to the Delivery Manager that several security testing user stories are added to the backlog. |  
| ​ | ​​Looks at the testability of a product | As part of backlog refinement they see that asking the developers to create a stub or mock will allow the team to be able to progress testing rather than having to wait for another user story to be completed. |
| ​Continually develop own skills as part of a program of professional development (5%) | ​Creates and takes pro-active ownership of a continuous learning cycle for themselves | ​Reviewing their current skill level, they identify that they have a knowledge gap on how DevOps works. They put together a plan that utilises books and online materials to gain a better understanding. |
