# What is safety ?

So the first question is what is safety in relation to UKHO products:

* An error in a product that could potentially impact the safety of the mariner
* A delay to the mariner that could potentially impact the safety of the mariner

# Some general principles

* Reliance on manual processes is minimised
* Best practices in software and test engineering are applied
* Sound human engineering principles are applied to the design of the software use interface to minmise the probability of human error
* Software with safety critical functionality must have clear evidance that all safety requirements have been met or relevant 
  mitigations have ben agreed.
* Failure modes, including hardware, software, human and system are addressed in the design of the software.
* Speak up, if you feel that safety is being compromised in some way, raise it!!!!!.
* Exercise judgement, not the same as going out on a limb but exercising common sense
* ALARP â€“ As low as reasonably practicable
* Safety Modelling using the Bowtie method is carried out
