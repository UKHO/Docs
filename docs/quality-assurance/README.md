# UKHO Test Community Docs

These documents detail how we work as a Test Community at UKHO. We aim to provide a framework for our testers, developers and community engineers to enable them to deliver testing that supports our desire to build and release good software quickly.

## Where to start

If you read nothing else, then read these three things:

* Our [Test Automation Strategy](test-automation-strategy.md) contains details of the UKHO approach to testing, including the Test Pyramid and Principles of Test Automation
* The [UKHO Delivery Quality Charter](ukho-quality-charter.md) assists delivery teams in adopting practices proven to improve quality of delivery
* The [BDD Reference Page](bdd.md) contains information on BDD to aid our use at UKHO
