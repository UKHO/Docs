## What is a Safety Modelling Workshop and what do you need to consider

It should be focused around the two key areas of

1. Error
2. Delay

This is very much focused around 'What if' questions and then of those 'What if' questions, what would the safety impact of that occuring.

 So in the case of error, what are all the possible errors that could occur and what is the potential risk to the safety of the mariner
 of that risk. Likewise what are all the possible delays that could occur and what risk to the mariner does this potentially create. As 
 the short film above describes, this is not a static event, you would run the same exercise a number of times over the course of a 
 project as risks and impacts do change.
 

 ## Keep it simple
 
 * To start with have two bowtie diagrams, one for error and one for delay. 
 * Use three colours, red, amber and green
 
 
 ## Outcome of a bowtie risk session
 
 * A list of risks and their potential impact to the mariner
 * A list of mitigations/ design changes/tests that may need to be included
 * The bowtie documents should be stored along with the other artifacts such as test approach etc.
 * Relevant PBI's tagged with a safety tag along with relevant details of what will be done to mitigate the safety impact.
 * Consideration of the whole system interaction and possible risks(This will develop as the system develops)
 * There will be some risks that cannot be mitigated against (These should be identfied and documented that the risk cannot be
   mitigated. These could include such as the system deliverying information correctly, the use then takes that information and 
   misinterprets the data.
   
 ** How often
 
 If possible add onto your current threat modelling meeting. Depending on the application you may well be able to bring forward
 previous bowties for that application as a starting point. 
 
 
 ** What tools to use
 
 Word, visio etc. Anything that lets you represent the bowtie diagram. The bowtie is a good visual way to show potential threats and impacts , but the most important thing is that you have carried out the analysis.
