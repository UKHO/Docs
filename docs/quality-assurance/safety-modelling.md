## What is a Safety Modelling Workshop and what do you need to consider

It should be focused around the two key areas of

1. Error (Data Intergrity)
2. Delay

This is very much focused around 'What if' questions and then of those 'What if' questions, what would the safety impact of that occuring, or indeed not occuring.

 So in the case of error (data intergrity) , what are all the possible errors that could occur and what is the potential risk to the end
 user. Likewise what are all the possible delays that could occur and what risk to the end user does  this potentially create. As 
 the short film above describes, this is not a static event, you would run the same exercise a number of times over the course of a 
 project as risks and impacts do change.
 
 Don't forget that as well as considering what the software should do, you need to consider what it should not do.
 

 ## Keep it simple
 
 * Don't over complicate the diagrams. 
 * Use three colours, red, amber and green (Red for critical threats, amber for serious and green for threats that have no safety
  impact.
 * Dont worry about what you use for the diagram - the process and output is the most important thing. 
 * Work at PBI level but its important that you think of how the system will work as it is the sum of all of its parts.
 
 
 
 ## Outcome of a bowtie risk session
 
 * Two bowtie diagrams , one for error and one for delay.
 * A list of mitigations/ design changes/tests that may need to be included
 * The bowtie documents should be stored along with the other artifacts such as test approach etc.
 * Relevant PBI's tagged with a safety tag along with relevant details of what will be done to mitigate the safety impact.
  
  
   
 ## How often
 
 
 As often as you run threat modelling ,if possible add onto your current threat modelling meeting. Depending on the application you may
 well be able to bring forward previous bowties for that application as a starting point. 
 
 
 ## What tools to use
 
 Word, visio etc. Anything that lets you represent the bowtie diagram. The bowtie is a good visual way to show potential threats and impacts , but the most important thing is that you have carried out the analysis.
