## What is a Safety Modelling Workshop and what do you need to consider

It should be focused around the two key areas of

1. Error (Data Intergrity)
2. Delay

This is very much focused around 'What if' questions and then of those 'What if' questions, what would the safety impact of that occuring, or indeed not occuring.

  Insert example bowtie
  
 

 ## Keep it simple
 
 * Don't over complicate the diagrams. 
 * Work at PBI level but its important that you think of how the system will work as it is the sum of all of its parts.
 * Don't worry about what you use for the diagram - the process and output is the most important thing. 
 
 
 
 ## Outcome of a bowtie risk session
 
 * Two bowtie diagrams , one for error and one for delay.
 * A list of mitigations/ design changes/tests that may need to be included
 * The bowtie documents should be stored along with the other artifacts such as test approach etc.
 * Relevant PBI's tagged with a safety tag along with relevant details of what will be done to mitigate the safety impact.
  
  
   
 ## How often
 
 
 On a PBI basis, so when you threat model the PBI you should safety model the PBI as well. 
 
 
 ## What tools to use
 
 Word, visio etc. Anything that lets you represent the bowtie diagram. The bowtie is a good visual way to show potential threats and impacts , but the most important thing is that you have carried out the analysis.
