## What is a Safety Modelling Workshop and what do you need to consider

It should be focused around the two key areas of

1. Error
2. Delay

This is very much focused around 'What if' questions and then of those 'What if' questions, what would the safety impact of that occuring.

Two examples of what if :

* What if the system fails, how quickly could it be recovered. It that recovery would take 2 days what risk to the mariner would that 
 delay cause. Are there any mitigations that could be put in place, if so then the two days may be acceptable,if not and the delay could
 potentially impact the safety of the mariner then another soloution to the recovery would need to be found.
 
 * What if an ENC was corrupted, what would the safety impact be. Can the system determine a corrupted cell and if so what alert 
   mechanism would need to be in place.
   
   Need to put in here details of the modelling workshop and the bowtie process
