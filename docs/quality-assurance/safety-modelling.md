## What is a Safety Modelling  and what do you need to consider

It should be focused around the two key areas of

1. Error (Data Intergrity)
2. Delay

This is very much focused around 'What if' questions and then of those 'What if' questions, what would the safety impact of that occuring, or indeed not occuring.

## Safety Modelling

  Insert example bowtie
  
 

 ## Keep it simple
 
 * Don't over complicate the diagrams. 
 * Work at PBI level but its important that you think of how the system will work as it is the sum of all of its parts.
 * Don't worry about what you use for the diagram - the process and output is the most important thing. 
 
 
 
 ## Outcome of a bowtie risk session
 
 * Relevant PBI's tagged with a safety tag along with relevant details of what will be done to mitigate the safety impact.
 * Some initial test design thoughts on how the risk could be tested for. Given that these are negative tests there will be a
   balance between effort required to test against likelihood/impact
  
  A final decesion as to the safety impact/consequencve would like with the PO (The PO will enagage with other SME's to determine if
  the safety risk is acceptable). This may mean that although there is a potential safety risk that risk is deemed manageable, or may 
  require remedial action.

  
  
   
 ## How often
 
 
 On a PBI basis, so when you threat model the PBI you should safety model the PBI as well. 
 
 
 ## What tools to use
 
 Word, visio etc. Anything that lets you represent the bowtie diagram. The bowtie is a good visual way to show potential threats and impacts , but the most important thing is that you have carried out the analysis.
