# General principles 

 

* The tester(s) within the team should have accountability for making sure safety is considered as part of their overall remit but the  whole team have responsibility for 
  inputting into the process, providing subject matter experience and guidance to the whole team. 

* Reliance on manual processes is minimised 

* Best practices in software and test engineering are applied 

* Sound human engineering principles are applied to the design of the software use interface to minimise the probability of human error 

* Software with safety related functionality must have clear evidence that all safety requirements have been met or relevant  

 * Mitigations have been agreed. 

* Failure modes, including hardware, software, human and system are addressed in the design of the software. 

* Speak up, if you feel that safety is being compromised in some way, raise it! 

* Exercise judgement, not the same as going out on a limb but exercising common sense 

* ALARP â€“ As low as reasonably practicable (This is ultimately decided by the product owner)  

* Safety Modelling using the Bowtie method is carried out at the right level (Project level normally gives the best return)   

* Reliable software does not equal safe software 

* The safety of a system can only be determined in the context of the whole (All of the component parts)
