# Licensing of Third Party Libraries Policy

## Background

All UKHO software should make use of third party components, in preference to re-writing, wherever practical, but with special consideration with respect to the licence under which a component is released. The reason being that use of a component can legally impose conditions according to its the terms of its licence. For example: using a component released under the GLP-3 licence requires (amongst other things) that code linked to the component must be disclosed under a GPL 3.0 compatible licence.​

## Guide

All third party components used in UKHO software **must** have been released under an appropriate licence included in the following list of approved licences.

All changes to third-party components **must** be reviewed by the team's Lead Engineer.

If a third party component is proposed for use that has not been released under an approved licence and the licence appears to be reasonable, then the team's Lead engineer should propose that the licence be added to the list at the Lead engineer's meeting. If further clarity is needed then TPE management​ and the Legal department will be consulted.
