# Source Control

## Repositories

All code **must** be stored in a source code repository.

A team may use one of the following systems:

- TFVC
- Git

If hosted at the UKHO, these must be used on the central TFS system.

It is also acceptable to use our official VSTS instance on Azure to provide version control.

The MINT team use a Gerrit / Git instance hosted on AWS.

No other source control systems are permitted.

Legacy SVN and SourceSafe repositories exist but new codebases must not be added to these.  If a system stored in one of these repositories needs to be changed, the opportunity should be taken to migrate the code base to a non-legacy repository.

## Branching

Branching policies and schemes are decided at the team level, according to that team's needs.

Branching policy and naming conventions are the responsibility of the lead engineers and must be published to the team.

## Check-in comments

All check-ins must be accompanied by a comment.  This should be enforced by the tooling.  The check-in comments should be subject to review as part of code review.

## Verification

 A team's source control system must be open to inspection, including history of check-in comments.

A team's branching policy and naming conventions must be available for verification.
