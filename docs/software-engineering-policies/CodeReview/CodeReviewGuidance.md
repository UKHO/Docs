# Code Review Guidance

## Review prompts

A checklist for what to cover in the review process for .NET can be found [here](
http://hweb50/Services/IMT/IS/ServiceSupport/DevSupport/Shared%20Documents/Code%20Review/Code%20Review%20Checklist.docx).

A checklist for legacy code can be found [here](http://hweb50/Services/IMT/IS/ServiceSupport/DevSupport/Shared%20Documents/Code%20Review/Legacy%20Code%20Review%20Checklist.docx).

## Project Specific Review prompts

The review prompts detailed in section 8 are generalised and therefore cannot be always applied to every project.  Therefore the guidance is that every project should detail its own specific set of review guidance. This guidance should be published on the project portal and reviewed each sprint.

## MINT

MINT has a separate set of code review guidelines.  They are documented and stored in the codebase [here](https://mint.marine-geospatial.org/gerrit/plugins/gitiles/dataengine/+/master/docs/review-guidelines.md).

MINT uses Gerrit for code reviews.  MINT Gerrit guidelines are [here](https://mint.marine-geospatial.org/gerrit/plugins/gitiles/dataengine/+/master/docs/gerrit-guidelines.md).
