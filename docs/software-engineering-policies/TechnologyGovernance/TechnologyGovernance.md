# Technology Governance

This page describes how UKHO engineering teams govern change in the technology we use.

## Aims
The aims of our tech governance process are to balance:
- Innovation
- Developer motivation

VERSUS

- Growing our expertise
- Sharing skills
- Re-using code
- Mobility

Further goals are to:
- Keep bureaucracy low
- Not undermine the role of solution architects
- Keep decision-making with experts

## Use of Tech Radars
Each team must maintain a tech radar on our standard tool.  The Lead Developer is accountable for making sure that this kept up to date.

When a change is made to a radar, the Lead Developer must do the following:

- If a technology enters "Assess" they must inform the Leads' meeting
- If they wish to move a technology into "Trial" they must ask permission from the Leads' meeting.  The decision is made by Lead Developers, by a simple majority.
- If they need to start using a technology urgently they may continue at risk until the next Leads' meeting.

## Solution Architecture and Architects
This process only covers technology that is not the responsibility of Solution Architects (SAs).  SAs will generally be concerned with building blocks (e.g. databases, network architecture, message transport, execution environments etc.), where Lead Developers will be concerned with lower level components, frameworks and development tools (e.g. programming languages, testing frameworks, UI frameworks, build tools).

Sometimes responsibility is not clear-cut, so it is vital that Lead Developers maintain a dialogue with their SA about technology choice.

## Scope
This technology governance process applies only to Software Engineering Teams.  It does not apply to Data Engineering Teams.
