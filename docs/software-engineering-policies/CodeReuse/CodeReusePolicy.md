# Code Reuse Policy

Code assets **must** be reused where possible.

Lead Engineers are accountable for effective:

- Reuse of assets from within their teams and from other teams and programmes;
- Communication of available assets to other teams;

The vehicle for achieving this is the UKHO InnerSource mechanism.

## Verification

Teams should be seen to be actively using shared assets

The assets that teams push to the UKHO InnerSource repository, with adequate test and documentation artefacts, are available for inspection.
