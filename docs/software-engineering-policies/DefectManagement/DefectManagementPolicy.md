# Defect Management Policy

An effective Defect Management workflow **must** be in place for all teams. The Defect Management workflow is to be created and maintained by each team, working with the **Test Leads** to ensure it meets the requirements outlined below.

The Defect Management workflow *should* include the following:

- The definition of a defect - what is a defect?
- Minimum detail required when logging a defect
- Where, when and how defects should be logged
- Defect Triage process (Does it contain enough detail?, Is it a defect?, Severity, When should it be fixed?) 
- Defect closure process

It is the team's responsibility to ensure that the Defect Management workflow is adhered to.
