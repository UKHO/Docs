# Development Principles

These are our overarching principles for development:

1. We understand the value of our code.
1. We understand the impact of failure and build appropriately.
1. We write high quality code.
1. We seek confidence in release.
1. We seek reuse of our code.
1. We take a full lifecycle view.
1. We keep our designs simple.
1. We seek opposing views.
1. We look externally when deciding about technology.

### We understand the value of our code

We understand the value of what we are delivering, using this to make decisions about how we work.

### We understand the impact of failure and build appropriately

We build in quality and security controls appropriate to the impact of failure of the systems.

### We write high quality code

We write code covered by automated tests and reviewed by colleagues.

### We seek confidence in release

We favour options that will increase our confidence in releasing products and services.

### We seek reuse of our code

We donâ€™t create the same thing twice. We look for opportunities to collaborate and re-use existing implementations.

### We take a full lifecycle view

We write systems that are robust and easy to support, with appropriate monitoring and instrumentation.

### We keep our designs simple

We favour designs that are easy to understand and communicate.

### We seek opposing views

We strive for teams that understand and create psychologically safe environments, openly seeking views that challenge our ideas and assumptions.

### We look externally when deciding about technology

We look for best practice and innovative solutions elsewhere in government and industry, and reuse them in the UKHO.
