# Creating a README.md file

## Overview

The README.md is the first file people look in when evaluating whether to use or contribute to a repo, so when writing them ensure the information is relevant to someone who doesn't know your repo and doesn't care about it. You need to provide just enough information for someone to understand the goals of the repo, download it and get started using it. The README.md is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and placed in the root directory of the repository. 

It is not the place for detailed documentation, keep that elsewhere and include links to it. The README.md should also feel familiar, you have probably looked at hundreds of README.md's over the year without realising, try to keep yours in the same style so it feels natural to the reader.
