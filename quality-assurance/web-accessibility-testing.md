# How to test for Accessibility

## Overview

When testing for accessibility you will need to include the following in your approach:

* Automated testing to identify common problems
* Manual testing using browser plugins that will automatically report problems
* Manual testing using screen readers
* Manual testing using screen magnifiers
* Manual testing using voice control

You also need to consider cross-browser testing. Unless you are supporting a single browser it's unlikely you will have enough time to complete all testing against all browsers. Therefore your test approach should be to carry out a selection of the above against all supported browsers.

## Test Approach

1. Integrate an automated tool into your build pipeline to identify common problems.
1. Run browser plugins manually against each page of your website. Note the different browsers supported by each.
1. Incorporate manual testing for screen readers and magnifiers, and for voice control. Read [how to test with assistive technologies](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies) to understand how to test using these.

## Automated Testing

* [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core)
* [ject-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-axe) - axe-core called by the Jest test framework.

## Manual Testing using browser plugins

* [Microsoft Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) - for Edge and Chrome
* [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) - for Chrome and Firefox
* [a11yTools](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a11ytools-web-accessibility/id1364813335?mt=12) - Safari on MacOS

## Manual testing using screen readers

* [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) - Windows
* [Windows Narrator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1) - built into Windows 10 but not used by many people so only use if NVDA cannot be
* [Apple VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/_1121.html) - MacOS

Note that JAWS is a common screen reader but it is not free. It also attempts to fix issues on-the-fly that does not help you find issues.

## Manual testing using screen magnifiers

* [Windows Magnifier](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-magnifier-to-make-things-on-the-screen-easier-to-see-414948ba-8b1c-d3bd-8615-0e5e32204198) - Windows 10
* [Apple Zoom](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210978) - MacOS

Note that ZoomText is a recommended tool for screen magnifiers but is not free.

## Manual testing using voice control

* [Windows Speech Recognition](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-voice-recognition-in-windows-10-83ff75bd-63eb-0b6c-18d4-6fae94050571) - Windows 10
* [Apple Dictation](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210539) - MacOS
