# How to test a web app for Accessibility

## Overview

When testing for accessibility you will need to include the following in your approach:

* Automated testing to identify common problems
* Manual testing using browser plugins that will automatically report problems
* Manual testing using a keyboard only
* Manual testing using screen readers
* Manual testing using screen magnifiers
* Manual testing using voice control

You also need to consider cross-browser testing. Unless you are supporting a single browser it's unlikely you will have enough time to complete all testing against all browsers. Therefore your test approach should be to carry out a selection of the above against all supported browsers.

## Test Approach

1. Automated testing using a tool in your build pipeline to identify common problems.
1. Manual testing using browser plugins against each page of your website. Note the different browsers supported by each.
1. Manual testing using assistive technologies (i.e. screen readers, screen magnifiers and voice control).

## Automated Testing

* [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core)
* [jest-axe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-axe) - axe-core called by the Jest test framework.
* [axe-playwright](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-playwright) - axe-core integrated with Playwright test framework.

## Manual Testing

### Browser plugins

* [Microsoft Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) - for Edge and Chrome
* [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) - for Chrome and Firefox
* [a11yTools](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a11ytools-web-accessibility/id1364813335?mt=12) - Safari on MacOS

### Keyboard only

Use the app using the keyboard only. See [WebAim Keyboard Accessibility](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/) to understand what to look for.

### Assistive Technologies

Read these guides to get an overview on how to test with assistive technologies:

* [gov.uk - testing with assistive technologies](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies).
* [BBC - how to use the individual assistive technologies](https://bbc.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/assistive-technology/testing.html).

#### Screen readers

* [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) - Windows
* [Windows Narrator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1) - built into Windows 10 but not used by many people so only use if NVDA cannot be
* [Apple VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/_1121.html) - MacOS

Note that JAWS is a common screen reader but it is not free. It also attempts to fix issues on-the-fly that does not help you find issues.

#### Screen magnifiers

* [Windows Magnifier](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-magnifier-to-make-things-on-the-screen-easier-to-see-414948ba-8b1c-d3bd-8615-0e5e32204198) - Windows 10
* [Apple Zoom](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210978) - MacOS

Note that ZoomText is a recommended tool for screen magnifiers but is not free.

#### Voice control

* [Windows Speech Recognition](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-voice-recognition-in-windows-10-83ff75bd-63eb-0b6c-18d4-6fae94050571) - Windows 10
* [Apple Dictation](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210539) - MacOS
