This page documents the role of a Test Lead in reviewing Test Approach / Test Summary Report documents.

A Test Lead should review all these documents.  In doing so, they are assuring the following:

## Test Approach

- Has the form been completed as far as possible? 
- Is the approach in line with the test policies? 
- Has the approach been agreed with appropriate people? 
- Does the tester need support from outside the team?

## Test Summary Report

- Has the testing been done according to the agreed approach? 
- Have appropriate people reviewed the testing (from the team and other SMEs)? 
- Is testing recorded, outstanding risks and defects approved etc.? 
- Is testware usable in future work?

Test Leads do not review individual tests.  They are not experts in the system so can’t take a detailed view on coverage.  They also do not make the decision to go live; the document provides key evidence to inform that decision. 
  
The responsibility for testing the product properly sits with the delivery team.  This process is facilitated by the team’s tester, but all team members need to understand and contribute.
