# How to test a desktop app for Accessibility

## Overview

Desktop apps do not have to adhere to the WCAG requirements that web apps have to. However, the app must still be accessible. There is a W3C working group looking into applying WCAG standards to other forms of ICT.

Read the [Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/non-web-ict/).

When testing for accessibility you will need to include the following in your approach:

* Use of accessibility test tooling
* Manual testing using a keyboard only
* Manual testing using screen readers
* Manual testing using screen magnifiers

Note that automated testing as part of a CI/CD pipeline will not be possible.

## Test Approach
