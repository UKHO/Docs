# Testing Principles

## We test at every stage of the development process

> We champion product quality from the very beginning, before any code is written and continues through every stage. This ensures that the product is tested the right way at the right time.

## We use automation whenever possible

> Automation is key to delivering in a DevOps world, we seek to automate everything that can be, allowing us to move faster and with greater certainty.

## We use Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) to help us deliver value to our customers

> BDD helps teams focus on the most valuable work to deliver, it helps clarify and ensure misunderstanding is reduced so that the right product is built.

## We take a holistic view of a product when testing

> We look to view the product as a whole, ensuring that testing encompasses non-functional as well as the functional areas of that product.

## We continuously improve our skills

> We are always learning, our people are key to our delivery and by always seeking to learn we allow ourselves to introduce new ideas, ways of working, to try new things.

## We support each other within our Test Community

> We have a community that supports each other to champion quality and to promote the value of software testing across the UKHO (including to Development and Citizen Tester communities).

## We collaborate across Government to learn and to teach

> We are reaching out across wider government to learn from other organisations and to pass on our knowledge that could help other organisations.

## We look to our partners to work to the same principles

> With our teams working to these principles, working with partners who work to similar ones can make the working relationships between us and the partner more productive.
