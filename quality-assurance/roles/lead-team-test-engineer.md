# Lead Test Engineer (Team)

| Area | Tasks | Example stories |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creating test automation (25%) | Responsible for writing automated tests in software development | Working as part of a delivery team, writing new and refactoring existing automated tests. |
| ​ | Accountable for ensuring that UKHO test automation code standards are maintained | Both testers and developers can write automated tests; the lead test engineer notices a new approach used, they review this with the author to ensure standards are met or that the standards need updating. |
| ​ | Responsible for pro-actively researching and recommending the use of technology | A company bring out a new tool for managing test data. The lead test engineer sees that this resolves a common problem in several teams. They research it and finds it to be fit for purpose and so recommends to Test Engineering. |
| ​ | Accountable for producing solutions that are supportable, including documentation, knowledge transfer and support documentation | The lead test engineer's delivery team is creating a new piece of software. They check that the team's "Definition of Done" covers the required quality assurance. |
| Create relevant test documents for project (e.g Test Approach, Test Summary Report) (5%)) | Responsible for the creation of the Test Approach and Test Summary reports as required | At the start of a project the test engineer takes ownership of producing the relevant document that provides details on how testing of the product will be undertaken. This will be produced in conjunction with and presented back to the rest of the team. If required, the test engineer will create a Test Summary Report that provides an overview of the testing completed. |
| Analysing Requirements and designing manual or automated tests (20%) | Review requirements to understand how they can be tested | The role helps review requirements; the lead test engineer sees that altering the requirement slightly would help the testing of it so they that altering the requirement would help the testing, so they discuss this with the rest of the team.. |
| ​ | ​Design manual tests | ​A feature needs to be manually tested so the lead test engineer uses test design techniques to create both happy and unhappy path test plans. |
| ​ | ​Design Automated tests | ​A feature will need automated tests; the lead test engineer uses test design techniques to create the relevant automated tests. |
| ​Leads Testing (20%) | Leads the team in ensuring that the product is tested to a satisfactory level to give confidence that when released it will function as intended | During a sprint, the lead test engineer notices that the developers do not have enough work to do. The lead test engineer discusses with the team and proposes that there are some test tasks that they could work on to keep the sprint on track. |
|   | Leads the use of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) within the delivery team | The team is finding it challenging to add acceptance criteria to user stories. They work with the Delivery Manager and the team using BDD techniques to create acceptance criteria. |
| ​ | Carries out exploratory testing  | A feature is under test; the lead test engineer feels that some exploratory testing will help look for defects.  They use a test charter and test persona to carry out some exploratory testing. |
| ​ | Responsible for coaching less experienced test automation engineers | The lead test engineer coaches a junior tester in BDD, reviewing their work and providing feedback and advice. |
| ​ | Responsible for ensuring that testing on a project adds up to a coherent whole | A project uses several different testing techniques - automated, manual, non-functional. The lead test engineer sees that there is a lack of security testing, so they recommend to the Delivery Manager that several security testing stories are added to the backlog. |
| ​ | Will be involved in hiring and other resourcing decisions (but is not responsible for recruitment) | Having received appropriate training, the lead test engineer is a member of the board on an interview of a test automation engineer. They assist in creating the questions used. |
| ​Software Testing Subject Matter Expert (10%) | Advise the team on the best approach for automated tests | ​The team are building a new application; the lead test engineer reviews the user stories and advises on the best approach for automated testing. |
| ​ | ​Helps the team on using best practice for writing Behaviour Driven Development testing | ​The lead test engineer sees that some of the team have less confidence than others in using BDD. They offer to provide some 1-2-1 coaching to improve the overall level of skill within the team. |
| ​ | ​​Looks at the testability of a product | As part of backlog refinement they see that implementing stubs or mocks will allow the team to progress testing rather than having to wait for another PBI to be completed. |
| Setup tasks for testing (5%) | ​Creates test data for a sprint | There is a requirement to test a complex change, the senior test engineer analyses which data will be needed for  testing and arranges the relevant test data. |
| ​ | ​Assists with preparing environments for testing | ​Prior to a sprint starting the lead test engineer runs some confidence tests to ensure that the test environment is ready for testing. |
| ​Act as Subject Matter Expert in a technology across UKHO (10%) | ​Leads that technology, its adoption and best practices across UKHO | ​The lead test engineer would champion the technology across all teams, create best practices, provide mentoring to teams, lead events and engage with external organisations, adding to the body of knowledge regarding the technology. |
| ​Continually develop own skills as part of a program of professional development (5%) | ​Creates and takes pro-active ownership of a continuous learning cycle for themselves | ​Reviewing their current skill level, they identify that they have a knowledge gap on how DevOps works. They put together a plan that utilises books, and online materials to gain a better understanding. |
