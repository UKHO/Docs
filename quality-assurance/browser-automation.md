## Introduction to the tools

The three recommended tools for Browser Automation (for UI, e2e and integration testing) are:

### Cypress

Cypress is a front end testing tool built for testing web apps. Cypress runs within available and supported browsers installed on the machine (the Electron browser is baked into Cypress and does not need to be installed separately). 

Cypress test code is executed directly within the browser as JavaScript, meaning there are no language or driver bindings and the tests can execute fast and reliably. It also has full DOM and network traffic recording to aid debugging within the Cypress Test Runner. Cypress also provide a [Real World App](https://cypress.io/blog/2020/06/11/introducing-the-cypress-real-world-app/?utm_content=149165601&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lcp-9293724) project to help learn Cypress best practices.

Cypress, however, does have its limitations. It has been created to test your application and your application only, and works best if the application is a Single Page Application; or a Multi Page Application in the same domain that does not utilise pop-ups or new tabs / windows. It is also possible for the tests to block JavaScript being executed by the site being tested and vice versa.

Some authentication scenarios can be worked out, primarily SSO and NTLM Windows Auth, but not MSAL Azure B2C Auth.

### Playwright

Playwright enables fast, reliable and capable automation across all modern browsers. It is a Node.js library (also available in Python, Java and .NET) to automate Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API. 

Upon install, Playwright downloads a version of Chromium/Chrome and uses the Chrome DevTools Protocol to orchestrate the browser instance. For Firefox and WebKit engines, Playwright downloads the actual browser but extends their debugging protocol capabilities to provide a unified API and features. There is no modification of the actual browsers, so that it is expected to work exactly the same in the testing and the real user's browser. Go [here for more information on the browser binaries](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers).

The core advantage of using Playwright over Cypress is that it is an out-of-process automation driver that is not limited by the scope of in-page JavaScript execution and can automate scenarios with multiple pages and popups.

Playwrights [documentation is excellent](https://playwright.dev/), the tool is being continually developed and the community is growing. See our [Playwright Page Object Model Template](https://github.com/UKHO/playwright-template) for advice on how to use Playwright in a UKHO project.

### Selenium

Selenium is a tool for web browser automation that uses WebDrivers to remotely control browser instances and emulate a userâ€™s interaction with the browser. This allows tests to be run across many browsers and versions using the associated WebDriver.

Selenium is popular because of its long history, large community and available language bindings - these include Java, C#, JavaScript and Python.

Selenium is a good tool to automate true E2E and user interactions, but it takes time, effort and experience to get the framework right. There is also significant overhead in maintaining WebDrivers and browser versions (though this overhead can be reduced through the use of tools such as [automated driver synchronisation](https://github.com/UKHO/ChromeDriverBinarySync-PSModule).

It is not as fast, intuitive or maintainable as Cypress and Playwright and so we do not recommend using it for new test suites.

## Which tool should I use

For most purposes [**Playwright**](https://playwright.dev/) is the tool we recommend.

That said, here are some questions to think about when choosing a tool.

### The application has multiple tabs / windows / domains

> Use Playwright.

### The application is a Single Page Application or a Multi Page Application in the same domain

> Use Playwright. Cypress will work in this scenario but Playwright is a better tool.

### I want to do E2E / Integration testing but our application uses MSAL Azure B2C authentication

> Use Playwright. As this authentication requires interactive login, Cypress cannot deal with this use case.

### I just want to quickly get going with pure UI testing

> Use Cypress or Playwright and stub or mock external dependencies as required. The Cypress development experience is very friendly for quickly putting together simple tests.

### I need to test against non-chromium based browser versions (e.g. Edge and IE)

> If yes, consider if this needs to be automated. If it does then use Selenium, if not refer back to the previous questions.
