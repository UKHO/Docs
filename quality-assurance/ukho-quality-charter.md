# UKHO Delivery Quality Charter

This is the UKHO Delivery Quality Charter - a set of objectives that will improve how teams can quality assure their software.

## The Team

* All members of the team are equal â€“ there should be no differences between developers and testers in:   
    * Permissions they have been assigned (e.g. permissions to access environments).
    * Access to hardware or software.
    * Weight of opinion.
* Teams that are multi-disciplinary, cross-functional and equal achieve better results.

## Ways of Working

* Planning, creating and executing tests (including manual testing) is the responsibility of **everyone** in the team.
* The role of the tester in the team is to **champion** quality assurance and testing at **all** stages of the development process.
* The tester ensures that a test approach is created and agreed with an appropriate set of stakeholders.  The whole delivery team is responsible for the quality of the test approach, and for carrying it out.
* The tester ensures that information about testing is gathered into a Test Summary Report (TSR), and that it is reviewed by an appropriate set of stakeholders.  The **whole delivery team** must review the TSR and agree with its conclusions.
* Test approaches should reflect the [UKHO Test Strategy](test-strategy.md), with appropriate levels of automated, manual and non-functional testing.


## Acceptance Criteria

* Every story will have acceptance criteria added before being worked on.
* Acceptance criteria will not be changed without cross-team awareness.
* Acceptance criteria will be testable, i.e. capable of being proven true or false.
* Testers should champion the use of good quality acceptance criteria.
