!Executable Specifications - Specflow and Cucumber

!!Background

An executable specification is an expression of business requirements, usually in a language that resembles prose, which can be executed as automated tests.  [Specflow](https://specflow.org/) and [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) are examples.  These both use a 'Given - When - Then' syntax, which the most common form of executable specification.

!!When to use executable specifications

Specflow and Cucumber add an extra technology, plus a layer of mapping code to a project.  In theory this is offset by the fact that tests can be created in collaboration with business users as part of a [BDD](./BDD.md) process.  It is therefore our policy that an executable specification like Specflow should NOT be used except as part of a BDD process.
