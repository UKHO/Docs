# Code Reuse Policy

Code assets **must** be reused where possible.

Lead Engineers are accountable for effective:

- Reuse of assets from within their teams and from other teams and programmes;
- Communication of available assets to other teams;

## Verification

Teams should be seen to be actively using shared assets
