# Coding Standards Policy

## Overview

These Coding Standards describe the default usage and configuration of their language, and associated tools within the Software Engineering discipline at the UK Hydrographic Office.

All Software Engineering projects should use these standards by default, however they are not mandatory and alternatives and deviations are permitted, provided that any such alternatives or deviations are fully captured, along with justifications for use, in project documentation.

Updates to these standards must be agreed and approved by the collective Lead Engineers meeting, and may be applied at any time.
