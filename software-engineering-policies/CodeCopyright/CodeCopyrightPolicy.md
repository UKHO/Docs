# Code Copyright Policy

The topic of copyright and licensing topic is owned by the [National Archives](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/).

All the code we create is [Crown copyright](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/uk-government-licensing-framework/open-government-licence/open-software-licences/).

We are encouraged to open source and license our code under the [Open Government License](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/uk-government-licensing-framework/open-government-licence/open-software-licences/), but are given freedom to use another open source license if we think it would promote adoption.

If we want to open source code we should use the [MIT license as per the policy](https://github.com/UKHO/Software-Engineering-Policies/blob/master/OpenSourceContribution/OpenSourceContributionPolicy.md) (appendix A).  This should assert Crown copyright, as per the example “Copyright (C) 2011 Crown copyright (United Kingdom Hydrographic Office)”).

Where we are not open sourcing, if there is no license explicitly included in a repo then no license is granted.  We can just miss out the license file.  We should still assert Crown copyright (although we don’t strictly have to).  Since there will be no license file, it should go somewhere prominent like a readme.  We don’t need to repeat it in every source file.
