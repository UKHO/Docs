# Container Policy
Throughout this policy the term 'Docker' will refer to the underlyng technology. It does not make a distinction between Docker Engine or Containerd, or any other container runime.

This is not a policy on Docker Desktop, which is a licensed product. Approval and license acquisition should follow the standard UKHO policy.

* Docker is a core software and test engineering tool.
* It should only be used within test and development environments.
* Use of docker should be considered on a case by case basis for dev and test, consideration of who will inherit the environments must be considered at the outset.
* Use of docker into a production environment will need to be approved by The Head of Software Engineering in conjunction with the Principal and Lead Software Engineers, until agreement is reached via APF forum.
* Container [best practices](./ContainerBestPracticies.md) shoud be adopted by all teams using containers.
* The Lead Software Engineer for each team is responsible for ensuring that this policy is adhered.
