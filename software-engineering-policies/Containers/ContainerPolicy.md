# Container Policy
This is not a policy on Docker Desktop, which is a licensed product. Approval and license acquisition should follow the standard UKHO policy.
This is not a policy on Kubernetes, the focus of this document is on containers and not their hosting environment.

* Containers are in use throughout Data Science both in development, test and production environments.
* Containers are a potential option for architects to utilise (a tool in the toolbox).
* Consideration should be made around why we want to utilise containers (what hosting environment considerations need to be made? AWS Batch, Legacy software etc)
* Use of a containerised product should be considered on a case by case basis and should form part of the APF approval process
* Consideration should be made around who will inherit the environments at the outset. i.e. is there expertise in how manage the hosting environment?
* Utilisation of Containers in develpment and test environments is acceptable without APF review.
* Containers are a core software and test engineering tool.
* Container [best practices](./ContainerBestPracticies.md) shoud be adopted by all teams using containers.
* The Lead Software Engineer for each team is responsible for ensuring that this policy is adhered.
