# Setting up your MSDN right.

You may be purchased an MSDN license ranging from MSDN Platforms up to Enterprise, depending on your needs. One of the benefits of an MSDN license is linked access to Azure Services and the option to spend monthly azure credits.

One of the main tools we use for source control is GitHub and Workflow using Azure DevOps.

MSDN + GitHub will be purchased for anyone with Pro and Enterprise Licenses.

## Setup for GitHub

In order to leverage the MSDN license against your github profile, you can do one of two things:

- The first is to create a github account linked to your work email, your MSDN is linked to your work email, so once the two find each other your account will instantly upgrade.
- The second option is to add your work email as an extra email on your [github profile](https://github.com/settings/emails), the act of adding your work email to your profile does the same thing as setting up a work specific account.

There are some caveats; MSDNs can only be leveraged against members of our organisation and only if their license has been purchased by the MoD, 3rd party license cannot be leveraged.

staff who are BPSS will not link to an MSDN license. However performing the above will allow your account to instantly link once you get clearance and become a member of the organisation.

## Setup for Azure DevOps

Your MSDN license gives you acccess to any Azure DevOps organisations, this works against your work email to begin with. browsing to [https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions), provides the option of adding an alternative account. This should primarily be your admin account, doing this will allow you to leverage the same benefits against that account.
