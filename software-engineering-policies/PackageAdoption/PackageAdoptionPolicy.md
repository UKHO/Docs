# Package Adoption

## Overview

UKHO has a [code reuse policy](https://github.com/UKHO/docs/blob/main/software-engineering-policies/CodeReuse/CodeReusePolicy.md) such that, where possible, we should be reusing assets. One way of achieving this is creating packages which can then be integrated by multiple teams. These packages have historically been the responsibility of the team that created them; however over time teams have changed according to business requirements and this has left a number of packages "orphaned" e.g. they only receive any attention if an integrating team find a vulnerability or can no longer utilise the package because it is using an out-of-support version of it's language, etc.

This policy aims to set out how such packages can be "adopted" so that they are receiving the appropriate level of development attention and maintenance whilst making clear to the business how much work is involved for the adopting team, both in terms of bringing the package to an acceptable state for initial adoption and ongoing capacity impact of taking on the maintenance. This applies to both currently orphaned packages and those that might be orphaned in the future by business change to teams.
