# Technical Debt Monitoring

The UKHO uses its [Grafana instance](https://grafana.mgmt.local/?orgId=1) to provide a series of dashboards for technical debt monitoring. The solution focuses on the UKHydro Azure DevOps instance and uses the [azdo-techdebt-exporter](https://github.com/UKHO/azdo-techdebt-exporter) Prometheus exporter to produce the dataset and metrics.

## Dashboard Breakdown

The dashboards can be found by selecting the "Search Dashboards" option (top left) and then opening the "Technical Debt" folder. Current dashboards are located here and all future dashboards created related to technical debt should be placed within this folder.

## Support and Improvements

Currently DDC supports the solution, for any ideas for improvements, innovations or extensions please contact the team via email.
