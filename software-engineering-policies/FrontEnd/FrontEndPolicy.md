## Design System

At the UKHO we have an [in house design system](https://github.com/UKHO/admiralty-design-system).

The design system repository is public which means that anyone in the world can view the code and commit history. We are currently not taking any contributions from people outside the UKHO and offer no support to external developers. 

For internal developers we offer support through the usage of Github issues. There are two types of issue template, bug and feature request, these are templates that will guide developers to provide us with enough information to work on the issue. 

The design system is supported primarily by the UX Champion team, however they only have part of their time dedicated to support, therefore if requests are urgent if possible we encourage teams to try and work through the issue themselves with guidance from the UX champions.

All new projects that have UI's and customer facing elements should consider using the design system within their project in order to make our products have a consistent look and feel. It also offers the benefits of familiarity to developers and confidence of the elements working together.

## Angular

Currently at the UKHO our first choice for language when building websites is Angular. This is currently where our specialties lie but this could change and evolve overtime depending on current recruitment trends. 

It is not a hard and fast rule, if teams have a technology that they are more familar with then discussions should be carried out to determine a more appropriate approach weighing up the upskilling time of the support team vs the speed of development time.

## User Interaction Designers

If a project will contain a user facing interface, we encourage all teams to reach out to User Experience Team. This is a team of full time designers who have a skill set in taking user needs, testing them with customers and users through various designs and then presenting them back to the team. The UKHO has a strong belief of customer centric design, so it is important that our designs are tested with real users to give them what they really want, not what we think they want.
