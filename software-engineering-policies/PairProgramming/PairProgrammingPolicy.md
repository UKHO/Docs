# Pair Programming Policy

## Guide
Most development activities will benefit from the collaboration of two or more colleagues working together. This practise encourages creativity, enhances problem solving and promotes knowledge sharing between colleagues.

Paired working is the preferred approach for any organisational activity that suits this style of working. Teams should consider each activity that it undertakes and apply paired working if possible and practical to do so.

Activities which may suit a paired working approach might include the creation of software, troubleshooting some issues and releasing new software to the live environment. Activities which are less likely to suit a paired approach might include reviewing code generated in a pull request or researching issues to solve a specific problem.
