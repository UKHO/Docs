# Pair Programming Policy

## â€‹Guide

All teams **must** carry out pair programming as a standard activity in their work.

Some types of work are suitable for pairing, others are not. Each team **must** create written guidelines about which types will be paired, and which not. The team's lead engineer is responsible for making sure these guidelines are suitable, and for enforcing them.

## Verify

Each team's pair programming guidelines must be available for inspection.
