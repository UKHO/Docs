# Technology Governance

This page describes how UKHO engineering teams govern change in the technology we use.

## Aims

The aims of our tech governance process are to balance:

* Innovation
* Developer motivation

VERSUS

* Growing our expertise
* Sharing skills
* Re-using code
* Mobility

Further goals are to:

* Keep bureaucracy low
* Not undermine the role of solution architects
* Keep decision-making with experts

## Use of Tech Radars

Each team must maintain a tech radar on our standard tool.  The Lead Developer is accountable for making sure that this kept up to date.

When a change is made to a radar, the Lead Developer must do the following:

* When a team begins to investigate or trial a new technology, they must add it to their team's tech radar as *"Monitor"* immediately, and they must inform the next Leads' meeting to get feedback. If the team subsequently decides not to continue to use the technology, they should remove it from their radar with some details as to why they chose not to continue with it.
* If they wish to adopt a technology, such as moving that technology into production or using the technology as part of their day-to-day team processes, they must ask permission from the Lead Developers' meeting and following approval, the technology must be moved into the *"Buy"* ring of the radar. The decision is made by Lead Developers by a simple majority.
* If they need to start using a technology urgently, they may continue at risk until the next Leads' meeting.

## Solution Architecture and Architects

This process only covers technology that is not the responsibility of Solution Architects (SAs).  SAs will generally be concerned with building blocks (e.g. databases, network architecture, message transport, execution environments etc.), where Lead Developers will be concerned with lower level components, frameworks and development tools (e.g. programming languages, testing frameworks, UI frameworks, build tools).

Sometimes responsibility is not clear-cut, so it is vital that Lead Developers maintain a dialogue with their SA about technology choice.

## Scope

This technology governance process applies only to Software Engineering Teams.  It does not apply to Data Engineering Teams.
