# NFRs

Non functional requirements must be seen as everyone's responsibility.

## Scope

This policy seeks to ensure that non functional requirements are present and delivered as part of a piece of work undertaken by a delivery team.

Please also see the [UKHO NFR definition](https://ukho.sharepoint.com/sites/eagwiki/Pages/NFR%27s.aspx).

## Implementation of policy

Delivery teams should ensure NFRs are present when starting a new piece of work. If this is not the case, the solution architect aligned with the team should be tasked with discovering and providing the relevant NFRs. If the team does not know who their solution architect is, they should consult with the architecture practice head.

The intended support team / Support Principal may well have their own set of NFRs for the impacted service(s) and should be consulted!

During development the NFRs may change as the solution progresses, but fulfilling the NFRs must **not** be de-prioritised or disregarded.

## Signing off Project

Demonstrating that the NFRs have been satisfied **must** be included as part of signing off a piece of work. 

## Support team handover

Where a piece of work undertaken by a delivery team is to be handed to a support team. The NFRs must be respected by the delivery team.

The support team have the authority to reject the delivery until their NFRs are satisfied.
